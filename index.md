My name is {{ site.name }}, I am currently an undergraduate student at Cornell University planning to major in mechanical engineering and minor in business. I am interested in all aspects involving the design and mechanical components of automotive and aviation. I look forward to bringing my skills to industry, exploring opportunities, and making new connections!
